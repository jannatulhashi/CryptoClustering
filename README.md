# CryptoClustering
This project aims to explore the relationship between short-term price changes and the overall behavior of cryptocurrencies. Utilizing Python and its vast ecosystem of data science libraries, I'll delve into the world of unsupervised learning to gain insights into this phenomenon.

## Instructions
1: Rename the **Crypto_Clustering_starter_code.ipynb** file as **Crypto_Clustering.ipynb**.
2: Load the **crypto_market_data.csv** into a DataFrame.
3: Get the summary statistics and plot the data to see what the data looks like before proceeding.
